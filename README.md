# Resume Telnet Server

This is a novel Node.js telnet server that I built to both get my feet wet with Node.js, and to serve my resume. To connect to the server, open up a terminal and enter the following:

    telnet resume.zacharyflower.com 2468

## Usage

To host your own server, clone this repository and run the server node:
